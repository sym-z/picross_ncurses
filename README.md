An implementation of Picross using the ncurses library.

Made after my first quarter at UCSC. Started December 2023

Puzzle text files are built in the format:

NCURSES is required to use this program. To install NCURSES, use the following command:

sudo apt install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev

Dependent on the C Language and its standard library, and the use of the GNU utility `make`.
